/**
 * PRNDL (pronounced "prindle") = Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Low. At least that's what it is in a real car.
 * Our car only has Park and Drive and a single switch to decide which one we're in.
 *
 * Make sure the driver is pressing the brake before they try to go into drive. Also, if the car is in drive
 * when it turns on (someone flipped the drive/park switch while the car was off or something), do not start in drive.
 * Just ignore the fact that it's in drive until they properly switch from park to drive with the brake pressed.
 *
 * Also make sure the Ready to Drive sound is played through the buzzer when we successfully switch into drive.
 * The judges would be upset if the sound played even when the inverter isn't capable of spinning the motor (say
 * the HV system is inactive).
 *
 * Read the rules about park/drive and the Ready to Drive Sound!
